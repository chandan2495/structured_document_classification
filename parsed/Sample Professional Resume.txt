</p>
<p>RESUME SAMPLES 
</p>
<p>Preparing an effective resume is a difficult and time-consuming task.  This handout 
</p>
<p>contains resume examples that will help you get started.  Different formats and styles 
</p>
<p>are used to illustrate the various suggestions and tips contained in the handout, 
</p>
<p>"Preparing Your Resume," also available through the Bellevue University Career Services 
</p>
<p>Center. 
</p>
<p> 
Remember, these are intended to serve only as examples.  You should modify or change 
</p>
<p>as appropriate to customize your resume according to your skills, experience, education, 
</p>
<p>and the job you’re applying.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>For additional guidance or assistance, contact the Career Services Center at  
</p>
<p>(402) 557-7423, (800) 756-7920 ext. 7423 or careerservices@bellevue.edu. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A Word of Caution: Please don’t be tempted to use one of the 
</p>
<p>Resume Wizards or Templates that are available online or 
</p>
<p>included in many word processing programs.  They can be difficult 
</p>
<p>to work with, don’t allow you to present yourself in the best 
</p>
<p>possible light—and employers can identify them easily. Instead, 
</p>
<p>create your resume as a simple document in MS Word, like the 
</p>
<p>examples included in this handout. </p>
