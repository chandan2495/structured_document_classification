and the price of electricity are low. 
</p>
<p> Developed an excel program to monitor the water chemistry of the Northeast power 
plants to insure that they are within the action level limits set by the Electric Power 
Research Institute. This program also helped the stations get approval for upgrades and 
repairs on equipment in their water cycle. 
</p>
<p> Inspected various equipment at the power station during their spring outage including 
the selective catalytic reducer, the induced draft fans, the six absorbers and various 
other equipment throughout the plant, and wrote inspection reports of the work that </p>
